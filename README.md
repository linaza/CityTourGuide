# CityTourGuide / OLDCITY GUIDE
  This repository holds  my graduation project at JCE software engineering - the **OldCityGuide** app, the project is to develop an application which helps the tourists and guides to discover the OldCity of Jerusalem even in offline mode, the app provides a map of the city by using the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/31.77659/35.22732).

## Problem difinition :
  The Tourist Information center provides free maps for tourists who come to Israel, the map is not really understandable, no explanations on how to get from point to point or information on existing attractions in the city!<br/>
Another problem that many tourists get lost from their groups or guides, then its hard to find them, so the tourists find it easer if they go to the Tourist Information center and the office will help. <br/>
Moreover the oldCity is full of fake guides, when a tourist is looking for a guide, there are plenty of people who claim to be a guide, end up stealing the tourists money.<br/>
Another serious problem is about with tourists special needs, the office doed not allow them to keep the [accessibility map](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/IsraelExperience/Experience2016/AccessibilityMap.jpg) for there own, they can only photograph it, because there are few such maps there.
## Solution :
Developing an application that helps tourists travel around the Old City more easily and conveniently by:
- Providing online/offline free virtual map for the oldcity of Jerusalem with attraction navigation by considering the attractive routes.
- providing map with accessable routes.
- Adding authorized guides to the application guides list and providing them usernames and passwords for security.
- Allow tracking of tourists and guides locations on the map.
- navigation to the free walking tours website.
- Providing information about all the map attractions.
- As bonus, providing the nearby cars rental companies.
## Tools & Practices :
This application is built using **Anguler** + **ionic 4** + **Webstorm** as a frame work. 
the map is built using **leaflet** library and the openStreetMap Tiles for the old city.
